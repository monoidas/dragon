(x=ruled out)
Potential methods:
Activation-Energy based:
- hypergolic starter reaction using an ATP-derivate and a organic peroxide
- Catalyzed starter reaction (Methane+O2?)
Bioelectricity:
- Piezo-crystals
- Electric-Eel-like Voltage igniter
Heat based:
x Flint stone (likely SiO2+FeS2) (potentially included in the burner teeth) - ruled out because of material demand, singular ignition and needed kinetic energy/collisions
- (potentially catalyzed) Peroxide (H2O2?) decomposition (H2O2 would be produced by peroxidase and catalase just as in Brachininae)

peroxide decomposition would be preferred currently. For H2O2 decomposition the required mass would be too high to be viable (at least 180% of the incendole, if air is heated for ignition and at least 20% of the incendole if the air is not heated).
