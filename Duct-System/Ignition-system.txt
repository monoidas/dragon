(x=ruled out)
Potential methods:
Activation-Energy based:
- hypergolic starter reaction using an ATP-derivate and a organic peroxide
- Catalyzed starter reaction (Methane+O2?)
Bioelectricity:
- Piezo-crystals
- Electric-Eel-like Voltage igniter
Heat based:
x Flint stone (likely SiO2+FeS2) (potentially included in the burner teeth) - ruled out because of material demand, singular ignition and needed kinetic energy/collisions
- (potentially catalyzed) Peroxide (H2O2?) decomposition (H2O2 would be produced by peroxidase and catalase just as in Brachininae)

h2o2 decomp. would be preferred currently.
